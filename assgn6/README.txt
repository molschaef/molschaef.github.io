JavaScript Functionality:

On the product details page (molschaef.github.io/assgn6/original.html):
-When a flavor is clicked, that flavor is set to active and the active class for all other flavors is replaced. This changes the selected flavor image to be in color and have a pink border. It also sets the flavor text to be pink.
-When a flavor is clicked, it changes the larger image below the flavor options and the product details to the right of that image, which includes flavor name, price, and product description.
-When a glaze is selected from the dropdown, that glaze is shown in the text below the drop down menus.
-When quantity is selected from the dropdown, that quantity is shown in the text below the drop down menus.
-When the user adds an item to their cart by clicking the button, Add to Cart, it updates the cart quantity. This cart quantity is displayed in the pink circle next to the cart icon in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
