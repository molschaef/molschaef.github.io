Added functionality:
1) Users can now add multiple products to their shopping cart from the products details page. The options they selected are stored and displayed on the shopping cart page, such as the image, flavor, quantity, glaze, and price.

2) Users can remove an item from their shopping cart by clicking “Remove”.

3) The price for individual items displayed on the shopping cart reflects the quantity they selected multiplied by the unit price. For example, the unit price of a Pumpkin Spice bun is $10.00. If they selected a quantity of three Pumpkin Spice buns, then the shopping cart will show a price of $30.00 for that item.

4) The total price is calculated on the shopping cart page. The total is equal to the sum of the price of each individual item. When an item is removed from the cart, the total is updated to reflect that change.
